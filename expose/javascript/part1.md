# 1. What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why. 
#    Line 9 will print "added result: 20"
#
# 2. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why. 
#    Line 13 will print "final result: 20"
#
# 3. What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why. ^^^^^
#    Line 9 will print "added result: 20"
#
# 4. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why. 
#    Line 13 will throw an error. Since we created result using the let declaration
#    this means the variable has block scope (it is only accessible in the block it was declared in)
#    Therefore referencing "result" outside the scope will not work as before
#  
# 5. What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why. ^^^^^
#    Line 9 will throw an error since it attempts to change the value of a constant. 
#    Constants cannot change therefore this is incorrect
# 
# 6. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why.
#    Just like the let declaration, the const declaration also has scope so it will throw an error.
